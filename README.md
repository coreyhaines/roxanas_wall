Hooking up Twilio and Pubnub for Awesomeness
=======

* Day 1, my friend, [Roxana Hadad](https://twitter.com/rhadad), tweets that she wished she had an app that would put text messages on a wall for people in her workshop to leave notes.
* Day 2, at [Code & Coffee](http://codeandcoffee.info/), I wrote a little app using sinatra to glue together [Twilio](http://twilio.com/) and [Pubnub](http://pubnub.com/). [Richard Cornish](https://github.com/richardcornish) helped with a nicer design.
* Day 3, Roxana uses it so that the 260 people in her workshop/panel can send "anonymous" text messages that show up on a projected screen.

Huzzah for awesome services like Twilio and Pubnub who make simple little glue applications easy to write!

ROCK!
